# Theme for Mon et Mine site

This is a child theme for the GeneratePress theme.

Nice things:

-  Added block editor colors
-  Added custom block variations
-  Added custom block styles
-  Removed jQuery migrate
-  Used CSS Global Variables (took the idea from twentytwentyone theme)
-  Used SASS for a better structure, and to generate two files: a main.css file for front-end, and editor-styles for back-end

That's all!
